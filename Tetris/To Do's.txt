To Do's

0. Shapes appear too low down on grid, not on top row
1. Draw block coloured, at specific row, column
2. BlockSize shouldnt be in shape objects, only in render
3. Create template of class, inherits from super class, private / public modifiers etc.
4. Add shape definition data to configuration (eg. number of shapes) and refer to this in ShapeFactory ??
