To Do's

1. Correct position of preview shape, maybes add properties to shape object to position better
	Preview shape position would be better with half block indented
2. Cancel all keys presses after shape has been placed
3. Move shape classes in separate folder

0. Shapes appear too low down on grid, not on top row
1. Draw block coloured, at specific row, column
2. BlockSize shouldnt be in shape objects, only in render
3. Create template of class, inherits from super class, private / public modifiers etc.
4. Add shape definition data to configuration (eg. number of shapes) and refer to this in ShapeFactory ??
